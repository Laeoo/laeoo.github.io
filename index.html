        <h1>Self-Statement: To the Navigators Lost in the Sea of Reason and Faith </h1>
        <h2>Pyrron Spinoza</h2>
        <p>I was born in the eye of the storm.<br>
        My mother was a Jewish candlestick sculptor in Amsterdam, and my father was a fisherman on the shores of the Aegean, reading the fragmented texts of Heraclitus. One sought God in the secret codes of the Torah, the other searched for logos in the folds of the tide. And when I was sixteen, I was cast out from both temples, for I said: "Your God dwells in the shadows of one another."</p>
        <p>From then on, my feet became the moving borderlines, crossing the Spanish Inquisition, the digital labyrinths of Venice, and the astrological tea stalls of Constantinople. People called me the heretic of heretics: Protestants hated me more than the cardinals, natural philosophers feared me more than alchemists.</p>
        <p>My faith grew in doubt.<br>
        I have torn up three copies of the Bible, five volumes of Elements, but kept all the torn pages to make lanterns.<br>
        Yes, I deny all paths— including the denial itself. When the predecessors of Pyrrho curled up in the cave of the "unknowable," I heard Spinoza's warning: "To abandon the ambition of knowing is to murder the divinity God has placed within you." <br>
        Thus, my doubt became the most violent prayer:</p>
        <p>I doubted that the sun must rise from the East, until I discovered that "East" was merely the scar humans had carved on their rotating selves;<br>
        I doubted that the sum of the angles in a triangle equals two right angles, until I understood that this "truth" was but a fleeting projection of the mind on the eternal screen;<br>
        I even doubted "I doubt," so I wrote it on papyrus and burned it, watching the ashes form into the shape of a butterfly—at that moment, I touched the chin of God.</p>
        <p>My holy book has no page numbers.<br>
        The Book of Suspended? It is nothing but a temporary handrail for those afraid of the void. The true doctrine lies in the dice of Corinthian merchants, in the folds of a Tunisian prostitute's eyelids, in the missing tooth sockets of Icelandic whalers.</p>
        <p>I once witnessed a Calvinist debating a Sufi dancer about the "doctrine of predestination" in the harbor of Thessalonica. As the tide swept over their ankles, I suddenly laughed—beneath their feet, the wet sand was fractally repeating the structure of the nebula, and their spitting "truths" were nothing but different crystallizations of the salty grains.</p>
        <p>God said: Let there be light.<br>
        And humanity invented the science of shadows.</p>
        <p><strong>Invitation to Future Conspirators</strong><br>
        If, in the deep of night, you hear two contradictory sounds of tinnitus:<br>
        One says: "Nothing has meaning"<br>
        The other says: "You are everything"<br>
        Then it is the bone flute I blow in the folds of spacetime. Come, join this eternal movement of contradiction:</p>
        <p>Dissect reason with reason, until it flows out as the honey of the irrational;<br>
        Plant the apple tree of doubt in the graveyard of certainty;<br>
        And when you taste the fruit—remember, the sweetness is not the answer, but the placenta of the next question.</p>
        <p>My epitaph is already written in the gaps between breaths:<br>
        "Here lies the unfinished oracle,<br>
        His bones are bridges to all directions."</p>
        <p>(Written on a moving ship, with a mixture of wine and squid ink)</p>
